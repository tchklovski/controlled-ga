search of approximators;
for example, we could search for
(fn [a, b] (expt (+ (expt a 2) (expt b 2)) (/ 1 2)))

the crux is in the mutation language.

## Usage

FIXME: write
(defun clojure-kill-swank ()
  "Kill swank process started by lein swank."
  (interactive)
  (let ((process (get-buffer-process "*clojure-swank*")))
    (when process
      (ignore-errors (slime-quit-lisp))
      (let ((timeout 10))
        (while (and (> timeout 0)
                    (eql 'run (process-status process)))
          (sit-for 1)
          (decf timeout)))
      (ignore-errors (kill-buffer "*clojure-swank*")))))


(defn target-fn
  [a b]
  (let [dim 2]
    (expt (+
           (expt a dim)
           (expt b dim))
          (/ dim))))
