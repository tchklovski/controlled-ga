# controlled-ga

just trying to learn a little (more) clojure, and experiment with some
ideas about "accelerating search".

we search for approximators of a target function;
for example, we could search for
(fn [x] (* x x))
We assess functions using rmse on [0,1]

the crux is in the mutator that generates candidates.
We want to mutate the mutators, identifying those that are able to improve
how the search evolves.

## Usage


## Misc
two-var target fn:
(defn target-fn
  [a b]
  (let [dim 2]
    (expt (+
           (expt a dim)
           (expt b dim))
          (/ dim))))
